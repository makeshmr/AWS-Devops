## Traffic Flow: From Internet to Application

This outlines the journey of a user request from the internet to an application hosted on AWS EC2 instances within private subnets.

**1. User Request:**
   - A user initiates a request from their web browser (e.g., to access `app.tcs.com`).

**2. Internet Gateway (IGW):**
   - The request's first point of contact within the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the Internet Gateway. It serves as the entry door for internet traffic.

**3. Public Subnet:**
   - The Internet Gateway routes the incoming traffic to resources within a public subnet.
   - A **Load Balancer** is typically placed in the public subnet, making it accessible from the internet.

**4. Load Balancer:**
   - The Load Balancer receives the incoming request.
   - It utilizes a configured **Target Group** to determine which healthy EC2 instances should receive the traffic.
   - Forwarding rules within the Load Balancer dictate how the traffic is distributed among the target instances.

**5. Private Subnets:**
   - The Load Balancer then forwards the traffic to EC2 instances located in private subnets.
   - Private subnets do not have direct routes to the Internet Gateway, enhancing the security of the application servers. Outbound internet traffic from these instances typically uses a NAT Gateway.

**6. EC2 Instances (Application):**
   - These are the virtual servers hosting the application code and serving the user's request.

**7. Security Group (on EC2 Instance):**
   - Before the request reaches the application on the EC2 instance, it is inspected by the instance's Security Group.
   - The Security Group acts as a stateful firewall, checking the inbound rules to ensure that traffic originating from the Load Balancer (on the correct port) is permitted.

**8. Route Tables:**
   - Although not a direct component in the data flow, Route Tables are crucial for directing network traffic:
     - The Route Table associated with the public subnet ensures that traffic from the Internet Gateway is correctly routed to the Load Balancer.
     - Route Tables associated with the private subnets enable communication between the EC2 instances and the Load Balancer, as well as other necessary internal communication.

**9. Response:**
   - If all configurations are correct and security checks pass, the request reaches the application.
   - The application processes the request and sends a response back through the same path in reverse: EC2 Instance -> Load Balancer -> Internet Gateway -> Internet -> User.
