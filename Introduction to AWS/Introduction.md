- What is Cloud?

  About 10–20 years ago, companies used to buy physical servers to run their applications. Just like how you install software on your laptop, 
  companies would install applications on these servers. They’d buy the servers from companies like IBM or HP, set them up in one place called a   data center, and connect everything with proper wiring, networking, and cooling systems.
  But there was a problem. These servers were expensive and powerful — for example, a server might have 100 GB of RAM and 100 CPUs. If you only     needed 1 GB of RAM and 1 CPU for an application, the rest of the resources would go to waste.

  To fix this, the concept of virtualization was introduced.
  Virtualization means creating virtual servers on top of a physical server. Instead of using one server for one application, 
  you can create multiple virtual machines (VMs) on the same physical server and run different applications on each one. 
  This saves cost and makes better use of server resources.

  How Does This Lead to Cloud?

  Once virtualization became popular, it was possible to create virtual servers remotely. For example, if a developer in India requests a       
  server, a system administrator in the U.S. can create  a virtual machine and share access — the developer doesn’t need to know where the   
  server physically exists.
  
  This idea of accessing servers and resources over the internet, without worrying about where they are, is called Cloud.

When companies build and manage their own virtualized setup internally, it’s called a Private Cloud.
