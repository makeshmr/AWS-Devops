### 🔐 Understanding Authentication and Authorization in AWS — A Bank Analogy

To understand **authentication** and **authorization** in AWS, let’s use a real-world example: a **bank**.

#### 🏦 Inside a Bank

A typical bank has multiple areas:
- **Service Desk** – For general customer queries (e.g., debit, credit, account issues).
- **Employee Area** – Where bank employees work.
- **Sensitive Area** – Stores critical items like user documents, internal records, and money.

To ensure **security** and **organization**, the bank applies two key rules:

1. **Authentication** – Only recognized people (like account holders or staff) can enter the bank.
2. **Authorization** – Once inside, individuals are only allowed to access specific areas based on their roles:
   - Customers can visit the Service Desk.
   - Employees can access the Employee Area.
   - Only authorized personnel can access the Sensitive Area.

Without these rules, anyone could walk into any area — putting sensitive data and resources at risk.

#### 🔁 Mapping the Bank to AWS

| Bank Concept             | AWS Equivalent                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Entering the bank        | **Authentication** (IAM login)          |
| Different areas in bank  | **AWS Services** (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS)   |
| Area-based restrictions  | **Authorization** (IAM Policies)        |
| Security guards & checks | MFA, IAM Roles, Permission Boundaries   |

#### 🔐 What is Authentication?

Authentication is about **verifying who you are**.

In AWS:
- You authenticate using **IAM credentials**, **Access Keys**, or **SSO (Single Sign-On)**.
- It answers the question:  
  ➤ *“Are you allowed to log into this AWS account?”*

---

#### ✅ What is Authorization?

Authorization is about **what you are allowed to do** after you log in.

In AWS:
- IAM Policies define:
  - **Which services** you can use (e.g., S3, EC2)
  - **Which actions** you can perform (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `ec2:StartInstances`)
  - **Which resources** you can interact with (e.g., specific S3 buckets or EC2 instances)

It answers the question:  
  ➤ *“What can you do once you're inside AWS?”*

---

#### ⚠️ Why Are Both Important?

- 🔐 Without **authentication**, anyone could gain access to your AWS environment.
- ✅ Without **authorization**, authenticated users could access and manipulate critical resources.

---

#### ✅ Summary

Just like a bank protects its operations and resources using authentication and authorization, AWS uses **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** to secure your cloud environment.

By enforcing both properly, you can:
- Protect sensitive AWS resources
- Restrict access to only trusted users
- Control what actions each user or service is allowed to perform

#### AWS IAM: Authentication & Authorization in a DevOps Context

##### Overview

As a **DevOps Engineer** at `example.com`, you are responsible for managing the AWS environment securely. This includes ensuring that users only have the access they need to perform their jobs — no more, no less.

This document outlines why **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is critical in AWS and how to properly implement it to enforce authentication and authorization within your organization.

---

#### Problem Without IAM

Imagine you’ve created an AWS account for your company and shared the **root account credentials** with the entire team.

##### Consequences:
- **Everyone** can access all AWS services (EC2, RDS, S3, EKS, etc.)
- Any user can **accidentally or intentionally**:
  - Terminate EC2 instances
  - Delete critical database tables in RDS
  - Remove production files from S3
- **No accountability or control**

> 🛑 This setup is highly insecure and violates best practices.

---

##### Solution: Use AWS IAM

**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** enables secure access control in AWS.

### IAM Solves:
- ✅ **Authentication** – Verify who the user is.
- ✅ **Authorization** – Define what the user can do.

---

##### Example Workflow: Onboarding a New User

Let’s say Employee `501` joins and needs access.

##### Step 1: Determine Access Requirements
Employee 501 needs:
- **Read access** to RDS (Database)
- **Access to EKS** (Kubernetes)

##### Step 2: DevOps Engineer Actions
1. Login to AWS using the **root account** (once only) or an **admin IAM user**.
2. Open the **IAM service**.
3. Create a **new IAM user**:
    - Username: `employee501`
    - Programmatic and/or Console access
4. Attach required **IAM Policies**:
    - `AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess`
    - Custom policy or managed policy for EKS access
5. Share credentials securely with the user.

##### Step 3: Result
Employee `501`:
- Can read data from RDS
- Can interact with EKS (as allowed)
- **Cannot delete** critical infrastructure or access other services

---

##### Best Practices

- 🔒 **Never share the root account**
- 🔐 Enable **MFA** on all accounts
- 🎯 Follow **least privilege principle**
- 📄 Use **IAM policies** to define access clearly
- 📦 Group users by **roles or departments** using IAM groups
