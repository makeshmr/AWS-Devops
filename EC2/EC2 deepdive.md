Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is one of the most widely used and powerful services offered by AWS. Understanding EC2 is essential for anyone starting their cloud journey, as it forms the backbone of many cloud-based architectures.

In this tutorial, we’ll cover both the theoretical concepts and the practical implementation of EC2 instances. By following along, you will:

🔹 Learn what EC2 is and why it’s so popular
🔹 Launch your own EC2 instance on AWS
🔹 Connect to the instance using SSH
🔹 Deploy a sample application on the instance
🔹 Access the deployed application from the internet (i.e., from your local laptop or anywhere in the world)

This hands-on session is designed to be interactive and beginner-friendly. Whether you're preparing for a certification or building your first cloud project, this tutorial will give you the skills to confidently work with EC2.

#### 💡 What is EC2?

**EC2** stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud**.

It is a **virtual server** provided by **AWS on demand**, allowing you to run applications, host websites, or deploy services in the cloud.

#### 🔍 Breaking Down the Term: EC2

##### 🖥️ Compute
- Refers to the **virtual hardware**: CPU, RAM, and disk.
- When you request an EC2 instance, you're essentially asking AWS to provision a **virtual server** for you.

##### ☁️ Cloud
- The virtual server runs on **AWS's cloud infrastructure**.
- You don't need to manage physical hardware — AWS takes care of that for you.

##### 📈 Elastic
- **Elastic** means **scalable** — you can scale resources **up or down** based on demand.
- Services like:
  - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
  - ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)
  - EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)  
  carry the "Elastic" prefix because they **support automatic or manual scaling**.

#### 🧰 Virtualization Simplified

Think of EC2 as a **virtual machine** similar to what you'd create on your laptop using VirtualBox or VMware.

- Just like you can install a **hypervisor** on your laptop to create multiple virtual machines,
  AWS uses **hypervisors** on powerful **physical servers** in data centers around the world.

- When you launch an EC2 instance:
  - AWS allocates resources from a physical server using virtualization.
  - You receive an **isolated, secure virtual machine** that behaves just like a standalone server.
